# This script works with the Day One command line utility found in the
# Application Package. The input to this script is the exported text file
# from OhLife.com (https://ohlife.com/export). Clicking the "Export" button 
# will save a .txt file to ~/Downloads/ohlife_YYYYMMDD.txt.
#
# Script idea was born after reading http://brettterpstra.com/logging-with-day-one-geek-style/
#
# Usage:
# 1. Save this file someplace (~/Downloads, perhaps?)
# 2. Open a Terminal in OS X (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app)
# 3. chmod +x ~/Downloads/ohlife2dayone.pl
# 4. cat ~/Downloads/ohlife_YYYYMMDD.txt | ~/Downloads/ohlife2dayone.pl
